# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Eidolon AI Personal Assistant in just 5 minutes! This guide assumes you've already completed the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## üèÅ First Launch

### 1. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that Eidolon is properly installed
python -m eidolon --version

# Expected output: Eidolon v1.0.0 (or current version)
```

### 2. Initialize Your Environment

```bash
# Run the guided setup (recommended for first-time users)
python -m eidolon init --guided
```

This will:
- Create your configuration directory
- Set up default settings
- Create the initial database
- Configure basic privacy settings

### 3. Check System Status

```bash
# Verify everything is working correctly
python -m eidolon status
```

You should see output indicating all components are ready.

## üéØ Core Workflow

### Start Monitoring (Background Mode)

```bash
# Start background monitoring
python -m eidolon capture --daemon

# Or run in foreground to see activity
python -m eidolon capture
```

Eidolon will now:
- Capture screenshots at intelligent intervals
- Extract text and UI elements using OCR
- Analyze content for importance
- Store everything in your local knowledge base

### Your First Search

After a few minutes of activity, try searching:

```bash
# Search for recent activity
python -m eidolon search "what did I work on today?"

# Search for specific content
python -m eidolon search "email" --time-range "last 2 hours"

# Search with filters
python -m eidolon search "meeting" --type "text" --limit 5
```

### Interactive Chat Mode

Launch the interactive chat interface:

```bash
# Start chat mode
python -m eidolon chat
```

Now you can ask natural language questions:
- "What projects have I been working on this week?"
- "Show me all the websites I visited about Python"
- "What emails did I receive today?"
- "Summarize my activity from yesterday"

## üîß Essential Configuration

### Privacy Settings

Configure what Eidolon monitors:

```bash
# Edit privacy settings
python -m eidolon config privacy

# Exclude specific applications
python -m eidolon config set privacy.excluded_apps "['1Password', 'Banking App']"

# Set sensitive patterns to redact
python -m eidolon config set privacy.sensitive_patterns "['password', 'ssn', 'credit card']"
```

### Performance Tuning

Adjust capture frequency based on your needs:

```bash
# Reduce frequency for better performance (capture every 30 seconds)
python -m eidolon config set observer.capture_interval 30

# Increase sensitivity for more captures
python -m eidolon config set observer.activity_threshold 0.03
```

### Cloud AI Integration (Optional)

For enhanced analysis capabilities, configure cloud APIs:

```bash
# Set OpenAI API key for advanced analysis
python -m eidolon config set analysis.cloud_apis.openai_key "your-api-key"

# Configure cost limits
python -m eidolon config set analysis.routing.cost_limit_daily 5.0
```
